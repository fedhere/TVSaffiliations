# TVSaffiliations

These chunks of python code allow the user to collect emails of LSST TVS members based on affiliation. Two scripts are provided, one which uses the command line argument, and one which uses a gui, which ultimately is to be implemented on my website.

Change the value of tvsfile in conf.py to the correct GoogleDoc file link, which the TVS co-chairs Ashish and Federica can provide.

## Withot the GUI: 

### to obtain all contact info:
run as

    python extractemailsW.py <subgroup>

this creates (overwrites if existing) 2 output files with the contact info: SubgroupNames_<subgroup>.dat which contains the Last-, First-Name, and email in a tsv file, and SubgroupEmails_<subgroup>.dat, which contains the emails only (for easier copy and paste in your email To field).

to see a list of the subgroups run as   

    python extractemailsW.py  -h

### to just get the emails printed on standard output (i.e. dumped to your terminal - generally)

run as 

    python extractemails_nogui.py <subgroups>

to see a list of the subgroups run as   

    python extractemails_nogui.py  -h


## GUI use:

run as 

    python extractemails.py
  

The GUI will ask you which affiliation you are interested in and a list of emails of member with that primary subgroup affiliation, and a list of emails of member with that secondary subgroup affiliation are printed.
